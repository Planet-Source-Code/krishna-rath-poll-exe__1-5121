    file generates the results of a Poll.<br>
    many a times you might have seen polls on websites and liked it. So, theres the<br>
    source code for it<br>
    <br>
    You need to run this from the HTML page itself..which is enclosed in the zip file Poll.zip<br>
    Note the follwing files should be present in the poll.zip<br>
    1. poll.html<br>
    2. poll.bas<br>
    3. cgi32.bas<br>
    4. readme.txt<br>
    5. poll.exe<br>
    6. some extra VB files<br>
    <br>
    In WinCGI, writing a CGI script is very easy. All you have to do is to include<br>
    the cgi32.bas file with your project. then write another module which<br>
    will contain your source code. the poll.bas shall clear most of the<br>
    doubts regarding the basics of WinCGI<br>
    note to run WinCGI you need a server that runs on Win9x or NT, IIS4<br>
    You cannot run these scripts on an UNIX server like tripod.com ( where I have<br>
    my unofficial home page and my scripts donot run. I have to abandon the site, and build a
    new one!!)<br>
    <br>
    In case you want to test the program you can use a free server like Sambar server( that I
    use).<br>
    To run and install sambar (www.sambar.com) please read the help file provided along the
    program).<br>
    Incase of any doubts...or if your programs are not working fine then<br>
    contact me at krishna_rath@hotmail.com. or krath@rediffmail.com....Incase my hotmail
    account is hacked and you donot recieve an reply by a week.<br>
    This script can run on any win server ....but I tested it on Sambar cause it is free!!<br>
    <br>

    <br>
    If you have used WinCGI then skip this part<br>
    How to run this file<br>
    First, if you make any changes to the file then complie it to an EXE file.<br>
    2. place the HTML page( poll.html) on your server folder ( if it is sambar server, then
    place it in the &quot;path\sambar\docs&quot; folder, where path is the &quot;c:\&quot; or
    &quot;d:\&quot;<br>
    3. place the Poll.exe and the Poll.txt file in &quot;path\sambar\cgi-win\&quot; folder, if
    cgi-bin does not exists then create it<br>
    4. If your server is not running then start it.<br>
    5. Open your browser, type in 127.0.0.1\poll.html. The poll.html file should appear. If it
    does not recheck your configuration<br>
    6. Click on the Poll button and see the results!!! If you donot see anything or see a
    &quot;page not found&quot; or a &quot;Error no:500&quot; it means that the poll.exe is not
    placed correctly.<br>
    7. If everything goes right please mail me at krishna_rath@hotmail.com or
    krath@rediffmail.com, ...Incase my hotmail account is hacked and you donot recieve an
    reply by a week.<br>
